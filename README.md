# TASK 1:Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry using Logistic Regression

**Business Problem Overview**
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.
In this project, it is analysed customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, built predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identifies the main indicators of churn.

**What is Customer Churn?**
Customer churn is defined as when customers or subscribers discontinue doing business with a firm or service.
Customers in the telecom industry can choose from a variety of service providers and actively switch from one to the next. The telecommunications business has an annual churn rate of 15-25 percent in this highly competitive market.
Customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers.
To detect early signs of potential churn, one must first develop a holistic view of the customers and their interactions across numerous channels.As a result, by addressing churn, these businesses may not only preserve their market position, but also grow and thrive. More customers they have in their network, the lower the cost of initiation and the larger the profit. As a result, the company's key focus for success is reducing client attrition and implementing effective retention strategy.


**Objectives:**
Finding the % of Churn Customers and customers that keep in with the active services.
Analysing the data in terms of various features responsible for customer Churn
Finding a most suited machine learning model for correct classification of Churn and non churn customers.

# TASK 2:Market Basket Analysis in Python using Apriori Algorithm


First Task: Implement the Apriori algorithm to find all frequent patterns under different settings of the minimum frequency (minimum support/#transactions). Vary the minimum frequency minFreq as 0.0001, 0.0002, 0.0003, 0.0004 and 0.0005. Report the number of frequent patterns, as well as the number of size-K frequent patterns for each size with at least one frequent pattern, under each setting of minFreq.

Second Task: Try to optimize your algorithm using acceleration techniques. Try to make your algorithm finish computing for the task in (1) within 10 mins. Explain each specific acceleration you adopt by providing a running time comparison between adopting the acceleration and not adopting the acceleration.
Market Basket Analysis using Apriori Algorithm on grocery data for generating frequent item sets that are purchased together. The findings from the Apriori Alorithm can be used by the Marketing Team to formulate strategies for increasing sales.

# TASK3(golden project): Building a Resume Parser Using NLP(Spacy) and Machine Learning

What does a resume parser do?

A Résumé parsing technology converts an unstructured form of resume data into a structured format. A Resume parser analyses resume data and extract it into machine-readable output such as XML, JSON. A CV/resume parser helps automatically store, organize, and analyze resume data to find the best candidate.
We will using Natural language processing in order to get the results accurately.A resume parser and position parser to help you perform job matching based on keywords.

The purpose of this project is to use the power of Natural Language Processing to distinguish sections and keywords in a resume or position. You then have all the information to conduct an optimal analysis.

# TASK4(Golden project):Price Recommendation for Online Sellers
Product pricing gets even harder at scale, considering just how many products are sold online. Clothing has strong seasonal pricing trends and is heavily influenced by brand names, while electronics have fluctuating prices based on product specs.

Mercari, Japan’s biggest community-powered shopping app, knows this problem deeply. They’d like to offer pricing suggestions to sellers, but this is tough because their sellers are enabled to put just about anything, or any bundle of things, on Mercari's marketplace.

In this Mercari’s challenging you to build an algorithm that automatically suggests the right product prices. You’ll be provided user-inputted text descriptions of their products, including details like product category name, brand name, and item condition.
